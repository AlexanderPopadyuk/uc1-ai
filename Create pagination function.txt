Create a function that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of records. The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API).

To limit the number of records you retrieve from an array, you can use the .slice() method for arrays.

Here's a function called limitRecords that retrieves the first n records from an array:

javascript
Copy code
function limitRecords(n, records) {
  return records.slice(0, n);
}
The function accepts a number n and an array of records. It then retrieves the first n records from the array.

However, if you want to limit the number of records directly from the API, you typically have to check if the API provides pagination or record limiting parameters. If the API does support such parameters, you can make use of them directly in your API request.

In the case of the API you're working with, https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all, as of my last update in September 2021, there isn't built-in pagination. So, you would have to fetch all the data and then use the limitRecords function to get the desired number of records.

Here's a demonstration of how you might use this within a component:

javascript
Copy code
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function CountriesList() {
  const [countries, setCountries] = useState([]);
  const [limit, setLimit] = useState(15);  // Default limit of 15 records

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all')
      .then(response => {
        const limitedCountries = limitRecords(limit, response.data);
        setCountries(limitedCountries);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
      });
  }, [limit]);  // If the 'limit' changes, the API request will be made again

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {countries.map(country => (
          <li key={country.cca3}>{country.name.common}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>

      {/* Input to change the limit */}
      <div>
        <label>
          Number of records:
          <input
            type="number"
            value={limit}
            onChange={e => setLimit(Number(e.target.value))}
          />
        </label>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function limitRecords(n, records) {
  return records.slice(0, n);
}

export default CountriesList;
In this demonstration, there's an input field where users can change the number of records they want to see. Adjusting this number will update the list to show the desired number of countries.
