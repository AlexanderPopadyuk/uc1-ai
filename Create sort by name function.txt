Create a function that accepts a string as an attribute and can sort data by  'name/common'. The sort should accept string ` ascend or descend ` and sort countries name by provided attribute (e.g. providing attribute ascend all countries should be sorted from A to Z).

Certainly! To create a sorting function based on the name/common attribute of countries, you can use the native sort() method for arrays. Here's a function called sortCountriesByName that does exactly that:

javascript
Copy code
function sortCountriesByName(order, countries) {
  return countries.slice().sort((a, b) => {
    if (order === "ascend") {
      return a.name.common.localeCompare(b.name.common);
    } else if (order === "descend") {
      return b.name.common.localeCompare(a.name.common);
    } else {
      throw new Error("Invalid sorting order provided. Use either 'ascend' or 'descend'.");
    }
  });
}
The function accepts a string parameter order which can either be "ascend" or "descend", and an array of countries. It then sorts the countries in ascending or descending order based on the name/common attribute.

Here's a brief breakdown of the function:

The .slice() method creates a shallow copy of the countries array, ensuring that the original array remains unmodified.
The .sort() method sorts the array based on the provided comparison function.
The .localeCompare() method provides a string comparison, which works well for sorting strings in alphabetical order.
You can now integrate this function with your component or logic to sort the list of countries based on the user's input.
